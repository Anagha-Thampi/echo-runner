## Game Description
[2-3 lines about what your game is, the genre, and what makes it fun or unique.]

## The Concept
Echo Runner is a 2D platformer where your shadow mimics your movements with a short delay, creating challenging timing puzzles. The game is fun because players must plan jumps and actions carefully, turning every level into a tense, strategic race against their own echo. Its unique twist lies in the “mirror shadow” mechanic, where your past actions come back to challenge you.
